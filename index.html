            <h2>Mashrafe Bin Mortaza as a cricketer</h2>
            <p>Mashrafe rose to prominence in 2004, when he claimed the mighty wickets of Virender Sehwag and MS Dhoni
                and made a valuable 31* at the lower order when Bangladesh defeated India for the first time.



                In the calendar year of 2006, Mortaza was the world's highest wicket taker in ODIs, collecting 49
                wickets, which included his personal best of 6/26.



                The following year he played an instrumental role in his side's shock victory over India in the 2007 ICC
                Cricket World Cup, taking 4/38 and was adjudged the Man of the Match.



                When New Zealand toured Bangladesh in October 2008, Mortaza was part of Bangladesh's maiden ODI victory
                over the Kiwis as he took 4/44.



                In 2009, Mashrafe and Nazmul Hossain sunk Sri Lanka to a new low, picking up five wickets for just six
                runs.



                In the 2012 Asia Cup, he struggled to bowl his quota of 10 overs due to an injury but finished as
                Bangladesh's leading seamer with six wickets from four matches.</p>
